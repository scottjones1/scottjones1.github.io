<p>Three big benefits of wireless security systems for occupants are their expandability, portability and impermanence. Tenants, unlike property owners, normally avoid making permanent changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't practical; they include drilling into walls and setting up irreversible electrical circuits. On the other hand, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entranceways with detachable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other components can easily be set up at various residential or commercial properties in the future, and wireless systems are quickly expanded with new components too.
