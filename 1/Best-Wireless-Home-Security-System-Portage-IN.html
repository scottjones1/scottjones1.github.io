<p>As a temptation to buy an alarm, a variety of companies offer "complimentary monitoring services" for the very first couple of months. Many insurance companies offer discounts on insurance premiums to consumers with operable alarm systems. These discount rates may be as much as 20 percent for commercial customers, and somewhat less for residential owners. 16 In addition, lots of cops departments use a number of "free" incorrect alarms prior to imposing any fine, even though the cost to respond is significant right from the start.
