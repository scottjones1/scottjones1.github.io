<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or residential property is the responsibility of the whole community. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first concern you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The response depends upon a couple of aspects: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you mean to keep and how long you plan to keep documented video footage. The video footage is going to eat up storage area rapidly if there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video once you reach the system's capability, however if you're not cautious, the system may overwrite archived video that you still require.</p>
<p>No incorrect alarm penalties: Property owners with a self-monitored system are less most likely to dispatch the authorities for an incorrect alarm. Considering that the house owner is in charge of the system, cops are only called if there's a real emergency.

If  police are called for a false alarm, property owners might have to pay a fine for dispatching police unnecessarily. A self-monitored home limits the capacity for incorrect alarms and subsequent penalties.</p>
