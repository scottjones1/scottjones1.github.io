<p>When it comes to innovation, reliability is an extremely subjective matter, depending on which features and advantages an individual favors. Wireless security systems are more integratable and agile, but low signal strength and bad connection are still common complaints. Hardwired systems require very little upkeep, and except a general power blackout, are harder to disrupt. Regardless of a general improvement in wireless innovation, there appear to be fewer ways for hardwired systems to be interfered with and paralyzed.</p>

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
