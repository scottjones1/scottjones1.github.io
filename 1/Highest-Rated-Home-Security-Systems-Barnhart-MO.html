<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the extremely idea of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, spanning numerous years. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation slowly developed into the highly advanced yet budget friendly systems available today. The first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to tape-record video and watch it later.

<p>Storage: Cloud storage (where video is minimized a remote server operated by the producer, instead of at your house) is the norm these days, but some cameras keep recordings in your area on a microSD card or a connected hard disk drive. Onboard storage is good, but it will not be of much assistance if somebody steals the camera. Hackers can acquire control of wireless camera systems.

<p>Good image and I like that the cameras are white, they don't stand apart too much. Pretty easy to install.

The 2nd important thing to state is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a surprisingly ear-piercing in-built alarm, so it works as a home alarm system along with a security camera. That separates it from the products I have actually already written, and helps in part to explain its cost.</p>

<p>Unlike most other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter occasion alerts only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals every time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
