<p>Video cameras, or closed-circuit television (CCTV), are becoming an increasingly more extensive feature of American life. Fears of terrorism and the accessibility of ever-cheaper cameras have sped up the trend even more. Making use of sophisticated systems by authorities and other public security officials is particularly troubling in a democratic society. In lower Manhattan, for example, the police are planning to establish a centralized surveillance center where officers can see thousands of video cameras around the downtown - and police-operated cameras have actually proliferated in numerous other cities throughout America in just the past a number of years.</p>
<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a form of situational criminal offense prevention developed to prevent both personal and property crime and can be used in place of, or in addition to, police. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transmit pictures of a specific location of interest and are either monitored remotely by security workers or preprogramed to scan the defined area (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is thought that the increased surveillance provided by CCTV will lower criminal activity and boost arrest, without displacing criminal activity to other neighboring areas where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>

Rather, you turn notifies on and off. As you can't disarm it, it can't do things that a typical self-monitored system can do like trigger a camera to record or activate the siren.
