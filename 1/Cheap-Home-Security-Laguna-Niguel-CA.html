High-end home security companies like Vivint and ADT use only professional installation. But most other companies on our best home security systems list give you a DIY alternative. ADT does not have the strongest client service track record among the companies we considered, racking up more than 3,000 complaints on its Bbb page While we chalked the majority of this up to the truth that ADT has several million more clients than its rivals, our tester started his call with low expectations.</p>

Rather, you turn notifies on and off. As you can't disarm it, it can't do things that a typical self-monitored system can do like set off a camera to record or activate the siren.
