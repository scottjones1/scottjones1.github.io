Home automation is simple and convenient, and wireless systems help you automate your home that much easier.

That isn't to state that you can't have actually wired home automation, since you can, but automated equipment that is hardwired into your system is slower and harder to encrypt. It isn't very smart. Wireless devices communicate more safely and faster to other devices on the system and to the monitoring center (if you pick monitoring).</p>

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>
