<p>We like the 10-piece Alarm Security Kit since it consists of all the essentials (base station, keypad, motion sensor) plus a couple of extra entry sensors. Ring advises this bundle for homes with up to two bed rooms and around 2,000 square feet.

Now, a lot of security systems include a multitude of components, such as a base station, security camera, motion, entry, and glass break sensors, a keypad, and key fobs, to name a few parts.
