Rules such as these are created to restrict the time and resources that cops and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Many towns will fine you for a lot of false alarms.</p>

On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you do not wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting contract (and who does?). Our pick: No agreement.</p>
