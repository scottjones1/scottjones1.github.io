<p>Blink cameras are compact, include complimentary storage, and use two AA batteries that can last approximately two years. However, to conserve that battery power, recordings max out at simply 10 seconds, with the system leaving a space of in between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next. Likewise, the Blink does not offer you geofencing or two-way interaction, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker locations.
