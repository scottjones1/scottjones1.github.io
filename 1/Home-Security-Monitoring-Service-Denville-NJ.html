It also comes with two days of free cloud storage (with an option for more ), which can pack in clips of up to 3 minutes. Nevertheless, we had a handful of tests where recordings cut out in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second gaps in between clips. Protective Systems utilizes a touch-screen control panel and keypads, various sensors (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide gas, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes.
