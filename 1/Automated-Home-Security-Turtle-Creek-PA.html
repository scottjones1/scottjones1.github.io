<p>We like that the Argus 2 includes a color night vision choice, but the white and black version can in fact be clearer and provide you higher-quality video footage. This isn't actually a big deal thinking about the Argus 2's price and all its other functions-- however for the record, stick with black and white.

<p>I apologize to all the Wink fans out there, but to call Wink Lookout a security system is a stretch. Lookout is really simply a fantastic name for a set that includes a Wink clever home hub and a couple of security oriented sensing units. You can't arm and disarm the system. Rather, you turn alerts on and off. As you can't disarm it, it can't do things that a normal self-monitored system can do like trigger a camera to record or set off the siren.
