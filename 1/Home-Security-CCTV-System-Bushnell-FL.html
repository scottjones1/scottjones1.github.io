<p>Simply purchased a bullet ip system and definitely love it. Excellent clarity. I wanted to establish viewing on my cell phone but had a couple questions that the tech answered with ease. I Would certainly buy from cctvsecuritypros again. I highly advise this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stick out-- it's what offers the video history and smarter signals, for instance. However, those functions come at a comparatively steep rate: $5 each month ($50 each year) for the first camera for five days of video history, $10 monthly ($100 each year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 each month ($300 annually) for one month of video history.  For each additional camera, the subscription is marked down to about half of the preliminary cost. By contrast, Arlo charges $3 each month for person detection with 1 month of cloud storage, and Logitech charges $10 for those bumps and functions storage as much as 31 days.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
