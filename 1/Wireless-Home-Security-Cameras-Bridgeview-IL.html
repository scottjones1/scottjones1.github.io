ASecureLife's recommendation: Go to Ring for a well-priced Do It Yourself system that you can self-monitor or get professionally monitored for a small cost. We recommend the eight-piece kit since it features several windows and door sensing units for complete protection. We also advise including a doorbell camera at some point. The upfront cost of wireless security systems can be expensive. Consider the upfront cost of the control panel, activation costs, monitoring charges and all equipment. All of these costs will be paid in advance if the wireless security system is not on a contract basis. Some customers report spending $500 as much as $2,000 to start their wireless security system.</p>

Setting up the Arlo Pro 2 is a faff, involving a white box that connects to your router through an ethernet cable. However, get past that fiddly start and you discover this is a pretty decent home security camera.</p>
