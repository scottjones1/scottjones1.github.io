<p>B. This chapter governs alarm system systems meant to summon cops department workers, needs registration, evaluation of costs for excessive false alarm system, offers treatments for repeat transgressors, and offers an efficient date. While some vestiges of the old market remain, today's homeowners are presented with a lot more alternatives.
