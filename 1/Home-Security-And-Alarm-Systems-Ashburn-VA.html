<p>Get best-in-class security, plus smart home automation the whole family will love. Just how much bandwidth your camera uses depends on many elements. Some of the factors to consider consist of image resolution and whether your camera records everything or only clips activated by motion or noise. Home security systems are a one-time investment that can settle, big time, down the line. Does the ideal system have all the bells and whistles, from facial recognition to floodlights? Not necessarily. You'll desire cameras with solid basics: reputable, good image quality, and simple to operate.

<p>Viewing angle: The camera's field of view determines just how much it can see. As you're most likely monitoring a single room, you want a wide seeing angle. Many existing cameras fall in the 130-degree variety. These large angles can sometimes cause image distortion at the edges in the kind of a fisheye impact, especially when used in smaller sized rooms, but it's not like you're going to use a security to record pictures for your picture album.</p>
<p>The NVR eliminates these problems, because it is instead linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, generally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely because they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is linked to the exact same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
