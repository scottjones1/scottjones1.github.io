<p>The NVR eliminates these issues, due to the fact that it is rather connected directly to a network.

Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, just due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR.

(We think this is a better feature if you're putting the Circle 2 outside, where cars often pass.) Although having the subscription makes this camera smarter, it's terrific that it's not required, as it is with some cameras, including the Nest Cam.</p>
