<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
