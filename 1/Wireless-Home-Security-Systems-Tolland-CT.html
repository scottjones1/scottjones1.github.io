<p>SimpliSafe may be too restricted for you if you have a larger home or home you desire to keep an eye on. The only outdoor security camera that's presently readily available is the Video Doorbell Pro, which is fantastic for watching on visitors and bundle shipments, but it leaves other parts of your backyard vulnerable.

But you can link the Q with other Arlo outdoor and indoor cameras in the Arlo app, which is readily available for iOS, Android, Fire OS, and any Web web browser.
