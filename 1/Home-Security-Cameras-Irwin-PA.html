<h3>Home Security Monitoring in Pennsylvania</h3>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function.

As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
