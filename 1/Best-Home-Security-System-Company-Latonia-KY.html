<p>Cross-zoning is a technique that does not need a new keypad. Using multiple sensors to monitor activity in one location, software application analyses input from all the sources.

<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
