<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
