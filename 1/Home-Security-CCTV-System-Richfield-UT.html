<p>We don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complicated than it should be. Recordings, notifies, and combination all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we typically found action missing, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
<p>The genuine factor cameras are generally released is to decrease much pettier criminal activities. But it has actually not even been shown that they can do that.

"When the criminal activity and offense figures were adjusted to take account of the general downward trend in offenses and criminal activities," criminologists discovered in one research study, "decreases were noted in specific categories however there was no proof to recommend that the cameras had minimized crime in general in the city centre." A 2005 research study for the British Home Office also found that cameras did not cut crime or the fear of criminal activity (as had a 2002 research study, also for the British government).</p>
