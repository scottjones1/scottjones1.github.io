<p>The very first (and most obvious, for sure) element of a CCTV system are the security cameras. Which security cameras are ideal for your system depends on your individual requirements and budget; are you putting them indoors or outdoors? Is 1080P a large enough resolution? Will they be able to tape-record and see video efficiently in low-lighting? Are they placed with appropriate field of view, or will a PTZ (Pan Tilt Zoom) camera be required? These are very important questions to be thought about when choosing security cameras for your CCTV system.</p>
