<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a much better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>

<p>Focus on the existing lighting in the areas where you want to install security cameras. Look for the night vision series of each camera and think about how much area you want to cover.
