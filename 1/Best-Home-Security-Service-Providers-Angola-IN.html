<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
