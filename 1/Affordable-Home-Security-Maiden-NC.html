<p>This cool clever alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget. Throughout testing, we discovered it was easy to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was precise, with the siren quickly triggering when motion was found. We like that it also lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For many homes, you'll need several Minuts throughout your property, which can get pricey.
