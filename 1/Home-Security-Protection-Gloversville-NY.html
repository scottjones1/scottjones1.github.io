That is, they made us feel secure in our home and kept us plenty hectic with nifty wise home functions. We particularly liked the ADT Pulse App and controls.</p>

<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 provides free perks like individual detection, familiar-face informs, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage begins at $5 per month.) Nevertheless, in our tests the familiar-face informs worked only about half of the camera and the time consistently detached from the network numerous times a day (when everything else on our network appeared fine).
