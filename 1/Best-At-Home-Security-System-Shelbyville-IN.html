<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally regular because the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when customers understand that the economical consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
