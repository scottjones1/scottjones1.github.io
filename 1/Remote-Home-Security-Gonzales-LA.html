<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>

<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can interact with your home network wirelessly, which can be helpful for installation. Since it doesn't have wires that can be cut, it also makes your camera more tamper-proof.

These cameras are true 1080p and work perfectly right out of the box. They are well lined up and focused. The clarity is actually terrific. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
