<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or residential property is the responsibility of the whole neighborhood. Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first question you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The response depends upon a couple of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you intend to store and how long you plan to keep recorded video. The video is going to consume up storage space quickly if there are lots of cameras shooting in a higher resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video when you reach the system's capacity, however if you're not careful, the system may overwrite archived footage that you still require.</p>

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
