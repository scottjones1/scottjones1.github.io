These companies designed their equipment this way to make clients stick with them longer, due to the fact that changing monitoring companies indicates numerous dollars down the drain and a huge headache for consumers. How did they do it? They positioned 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their latest software and firmware. According to the report, one gadget was hacked within a few minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day. They didn't say which device was the very first, and the last to fall, however.</p>

<p>To evaluate reaction times for the monitoring company, we set off each system a minimum of 5 times, utilizing contact and motion sensors. Nevertheless, keep in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they respond at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls must be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.
