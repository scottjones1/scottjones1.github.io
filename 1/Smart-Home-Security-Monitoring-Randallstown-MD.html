The very first time our fast-acting monitoring system stops an attempted theft or fire in its tracks, you'll be delighted you contacted Wayne Alarm for your commercial fire and security needs.

(The rest of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.)

If you cancel early-- and some need 100%, a lot of home security companies will charge you around 75% of the remaining term of your agreement.</p>
