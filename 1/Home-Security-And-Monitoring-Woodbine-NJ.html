<p>We required guards for our annual Coats for the Cold event to protect the line camping tent and structure, keep order in the wee hours of the morning and to start the heating unit at 5am. The first guard arrived early so he could look at the whole area and speak with me about my issues. He was professional, considerate and very reassuring. The 2nd guard arrived in the middle of the night and took over. When I got here in the early morning to get the occasion started, he was also professional, considerate and comforting. We were really delighted with your service and I will suggest that we call on your company next year for this event. Thank you, Dennis and Henry, for a good night's sleep.
