<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring extensive however subtle changes to the character of our public areas. When citizens are being seen by the authorities - or aware they might be viewed at any time - they are more self-conscious and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "knowing that you are being enjoyed by armed government agents tends to deter things. You do not wish to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he warns, "people might learn to be careful about the regulars and books they check out in public, preventing titles that may alarm unseen observers. They may likewise put more thought into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang drug addicts, members or hookers." Undoubtedly, the studies of cameras in Britain found that individuals considered to be "out of time and place" with the environments were subjected to extended surveillance.</p>
<p>You would be hard-pressed to tell the difference in between 1080p and 4K resolution when looking at a normal camera image. The one significant benefit of 4K resolution is the capability to solve detail after the fact, which suggests that users can zoom in on details such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution provides some benefits, it also brings with it some downsides. 4K images are huge and use up a lot of tape-recording storage space. A lot, in reality, that they need about 4 times the hard disk drive area of 1080p to tape-record the very same length of video footage. Be prepared to spend more cash if extended video storage is very important.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
