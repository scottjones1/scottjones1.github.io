We love that the system includes a wifi security camera and only signals you when motion is created by something with the same heat pattern as a human (making sure there's no false informs). Nevertheless, you do need to register for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 each month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get signals on your phone if the sensors have actually been activated.

<p>Essentially the Mini Pano is created around a gimmick: a big fish-eye lens.
