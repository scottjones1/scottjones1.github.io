With conventional CCTV security cameras, the video signal is processed and sent in analog format for local seeing from one central monitoring area.

<p>CCTV cameras are positioned in areas where they are thought to be most reliable, which normally includes extremely populated towns, town hall, parking area, or different other high-crime locations (Welsh and Farrington 2008). Given that the placement of these cameras is very important, the crime patterns in areas of interest are generally studied for time periods to determine criminal activity hotspots where cameras could potentially be positioned.

<p>so state you have a camera that somebody can see it they would shoot it if they had a gun so I suggest to have cameras integrated in to a house that will be pertected by cameras. Box cameras present an obvious sign for anybody who passes by that they are being taped on CCTV and this can be a great deterrent of theft and criminal activity.

This additional cost isn't ideal, however when compared to the Frontpoint and Vivint $40-and $45- particular minimum prices each month for monitoring, Scout Alarm is a steal.</p>
