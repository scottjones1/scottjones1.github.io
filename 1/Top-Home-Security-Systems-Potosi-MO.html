<p>Discover how to design, develop, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and decrease criminal offense. The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, however it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a fantastic daytime image. In our screening, however, we found the motion sensor to be sensitive, with awful night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot.
