<p>We still think the Ring Alarm is a terrific alternative for a cheap home security system with wise home support. However perhaps skip the cameras for now. Hard disk storage is safe, secure, and convenient, with numerous systems offering expansion and totally free cloud storage, such as Arlo Pro 2 Wireless Home Security System. Where does the video feed go? Does the camera store to an SD card, which you'll need to manually eliminate to transfer the data? Does it go to your smartphone, or upload to services like Dropbox? For the best security, you want the information to be backed up in several locations. Another aspect is the number of days of footage are archived.
