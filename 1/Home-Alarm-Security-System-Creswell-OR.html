<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Likewise nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a much better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
