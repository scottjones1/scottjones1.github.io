The majority of your commercial security cameras consist of dry contact input ports to integrate alarms and informs, sensing units, gain access to control, and so on. My mind conceived a method of not just offering the client with the patient-monitoring system but incorporating it into their antiquated nurse call station system.</p>

Both are similarly susceptible to false alarms, so it depends on your personal preference. Easily pair with Ring Video Doorbells and Ring Security Cams, Alexa-enabled devices and third-party alarm devices for one total system.</p>
