<p>Pelco offers video surveillance cameras and video management services for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping others, centers, and hotels. IP cameras work by utilizing an IP (IP stands for web protocol) network, typically the same information network the rest of a company utilizes.

(For a take a look at our networking picks, see our guides to The very best Wi-Fi Router (for Many People)" and The Best Wi-Fi Extender and Signal Booster") It's a good guideline that if your smartphone or laptop computer gets good Wi-Fi reception in the location you wish to mount the camera, you likely won't have an issue.</p>
