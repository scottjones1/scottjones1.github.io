Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I evaluated, including creative things like incorporating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system.

<p>The cost of a home security system differs by provider. Some providers permit you to choose from preset equipment packages while others deal with you to build a tailored security system.
