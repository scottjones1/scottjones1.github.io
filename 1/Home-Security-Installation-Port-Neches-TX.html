"As soon as the criminal offense and offence figures were gotten used to take account of the basic downward trend in criminal activities and offenses," criminologists found in one study, "decreases were kept in mind in specific classifications but there was no evidence to suggest that the cameras had reduced criminal offense in general in the city centre."
