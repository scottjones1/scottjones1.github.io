CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal activity avoidance strategy, which argues that chances to anger can be decreased by modifying a variety of systems such as increasing the danger of a wrongdoer being apprehended, increasing the effort to commit the crime, reducing benefits from criminal activity commission, and decreasing justifications that give rise to criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011).
