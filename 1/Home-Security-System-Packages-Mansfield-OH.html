<p>Another essential topic to discuss is camera resolution. It can be confusing to comprehend how much is enough. In this short article, the term resolution" refers to the number of dots (pixels) that comprise a video photo; the more dots, the more comprehensive the video image. The very same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about four times as much photo information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also manufactured in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.
