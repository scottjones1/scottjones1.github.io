<p>Thanks to recent advancements in technology, wireless security systems are now as efficient as wired systems If you have actually made the decision to install an alarm system, you should consider the following benefits of wireless innovation. The $260 Fundamentals plan includes the base station, a keypad, 4 entry sensing units, one motion sensing unit, a backyard sign, and 2 window decals.
