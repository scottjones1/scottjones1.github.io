<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your home so we might point them at the exact same spot and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had actually installed on the deck by a licensed electrician (who happens to be my hubby). All of the cameras were linked to the very same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router indoors (roughly 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>
