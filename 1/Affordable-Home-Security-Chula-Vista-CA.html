<p>Home security systems and modern-day clever home capabilities and compatibilities allow you to take advantage of their sensing units and cameras directly from your phone. The arguments for and against CCTV cameras listed below are simply examples of comments that have been disputed, and are not designed to duplicate views from IFSEC International and its team. Advanced sensing units detect motion indoors and outdoors, listen for the sound of breaking glass to guard against trespassers and safeguard prized possessions. While many individuals utilize the term CCTV to refer to both IP and analog cameras, strictly speaking, the term needs to be restricted to explaining analog cameras.</p>

IP cameras that are linked to the same network, typically by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer footage to the NVR.

In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will work with a provided video recorder prior to purchasing.</p>
