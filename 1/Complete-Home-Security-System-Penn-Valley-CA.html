Nevertheless, the fact that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute significantly to cops capability to capture intruders makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by authorities and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers subsidize cops reaction to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a ineffective and costly technique to robbery reduction across a whole jurisdiction.</p>
