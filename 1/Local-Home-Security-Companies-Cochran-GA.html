<p>ADT licensed provider SafeStreets charges a $99 (or more) installation cost, but the brand name doesn't otherwise charge up front for a system it states is worth $1,300. The equipment's all provided by third parties, so what you receive may be from a different producer than the equipment your next-door neighbor received. Why's that? ADT utilizes an independent supplier model including third-party dealers. The dealers identify which equipment to utilize. Expenses for systems differ.
