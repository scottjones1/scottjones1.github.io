<p>Nurse calling systems usually include emergency buttons or pull strings within the patient's toilet. If a patient is having problem, he can press the button or pull the string and it will send an alert to the nurse station. This is a simple switch that is typically open or usually closed.

They may also be less cautious about covering their faces and their tracks if burglars can not see any security cameras.</p>
