<p>No incorrect alarm penalties: House owners with a self-monitored system are less likely to dispatch the police for a false alarm. Considering that the homeowner is in charge of the system, cops are only called if there's a real emergency. On the other hand, an expert monitoring company will contact authorities if a property owner can't verify a false alarm.

<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, due to the fact that it is instead connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the very same network, generally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, just due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transfer video to the NVR over Wi-Fi.
