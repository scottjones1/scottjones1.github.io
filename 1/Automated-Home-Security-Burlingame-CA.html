<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is a satisfaction to use as well (a lot better than the apps you get with some spending plan security cameras), though if you wish to enter its cleverest customisations, there is a little a knowing curve. For all the more basic smarts, it's terrific, though. If you do not currently have an Arlo camera or more in location, you're going to need to install a hub that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all link to the hub (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can suggest there are range problems.</p>
