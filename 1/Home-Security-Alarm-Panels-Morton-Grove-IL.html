<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
