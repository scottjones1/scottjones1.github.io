<p>We inform residential and non-residential alarm owners, operators and users about the alarm license requirement and incorrect alarm prevention measures. It is vital for an alarm system user, owner and operator to have accurate knowledge and thorough on all elements on the alarm system to make sure correct operation and to not trigger a false alarm. False alarms are a severe concern to public safety.

<p>A compelling argument in favor of getting the Circle Safe membership is that it adds individual detection, that makes for smarter smartphone notifies-- and, in many cases, fewer false signals. If the camera is pointed toward a high-traffic area, you won't need to stress over it recording or sending out an alert each time the canine walks by. (We think this is a more valuable function if you're positioning the Circle 2 outside, where cars and trucks frequently pass.) Although having the subscription makes this camera smarter, it's great that it's not necessary, as it is with some cameras, consisting of the Nest Camera.</p>
