When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching.

Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
