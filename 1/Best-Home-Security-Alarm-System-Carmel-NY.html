As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has explained, "knowing that you are being seen by armed federal government agents tends to put a damper on things. You don't wish to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he warns, "individuals might learn to be mindful about the periodicals and books they check out in public, preventing titles that might alarm hidden observers.
