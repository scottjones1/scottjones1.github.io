<h3>Highest Rated Home Security Systems in Virginia</h3>
<p>We don't suggest the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complicated than it should be. Recordings, alerts, and integration all require separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we typically found action missing, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
