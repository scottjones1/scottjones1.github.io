<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 provides totally free benefits like person detection, familiar-face notifies, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage begins at $5 per month.) However, in our tests the familiar-face informs worked only about 50 percent of the time and the camera routinely disconnected from the network several times a day (when everything else on our network seemed fine). The app was likewise painfully slow when we accessed live streams and tape-recorded clips, in addition to when we made modifications in the settings.</p>

However, to save that battery power, recordings max out at simply 10 seconds, with the system leaving a space of between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next. Also, the Blink does not give you geofencing or two-way communication, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker areas.
