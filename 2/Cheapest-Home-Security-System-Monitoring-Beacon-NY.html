<p>Just purchased a bullet ip system and definitely like it. Fantastic clarity. I wished to establish seeing on my cell phone however had a couple questions that the tech responded to with ease. I Would absolutely buy from cctvsecuritypros again. I extremely recommend this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stick out-- it's what offers the video history and smarter notifies, for instance.
