<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Need to be a better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
