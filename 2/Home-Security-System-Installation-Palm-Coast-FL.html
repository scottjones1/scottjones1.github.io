Nearly all standalone security cameras connect to your home's Wi-Fi so you can see what's going on from your phone or tablet, and the majority of have integrated sensing units that spot motion and noise and will send out push and email notices when those sensors are activated. You can generally tweak the camera's motion sensitivity to prevent incorrect alarms due to animal activity or passing automobiles if the camera is near a window, and you can develop a schedule that turns the sensors on and off during specific hours of the day.</p>
