No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
