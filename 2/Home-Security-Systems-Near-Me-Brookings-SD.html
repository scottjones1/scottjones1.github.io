<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>

<p>Smoke and fire alarms signal you if they identify a high-level of smoke or if the temperature level increases too quickly, either of which might indicate a fire. Most homes already have wireless smoke or fire alarms, but you can connect the alarm to your security system to include another layer of protection that might conserve your life or property.
