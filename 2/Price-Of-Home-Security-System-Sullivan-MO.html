<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function.

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally normal since the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as clients understand that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
