<p>Establishing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or home is the obligation of the entire community. Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first concern you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The answer hinges on a couple of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you intend to keep and the length of time you prepare to keep recorded video footage. If there are numerous cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the video is going to consume storage space rapidly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest footage as soon as you reach the system's capacity, but if you're not careful, the system might overwrite archived video that you still require.</p>
