<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the exact same resolution specification as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much broader location and for that reason offers less pixels per inch. Here is what this indicates, by method of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image across a far bigger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
