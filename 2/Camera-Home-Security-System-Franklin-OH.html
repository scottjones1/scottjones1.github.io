It functions as the brains of the system, getting in touch with sensors and third party-devices through Z-Wave and managing them utilizing the app or voice control.

Because this camera has no native geofencing features, you have to by hand stop notices (and recording, because it does that even when notifications are off). We likewise experienced above-average connectivity problems, with two Hive test systems detaching 8 times over two months.

The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based internet browsers, and it permits you to manage practically every aspect of the security system from another location, and it's extremely customizable.

The app was also painfully slow when we accessed live streams and taped clips, along with when we made changes in the settings.</p>
