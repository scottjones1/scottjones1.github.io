<p>Thanks to current improvements in technology, wireless security systems are now as efficient as wired systems If you've decided to install a burglar alarm, you need to think about the following benefits of wireless technology. The $260 Essentials package consists of the base station, a keypad, four entry sensing units, one motion sensor, a yard sign, and 2 window decals.

The $25-per-month Interactive plan adds control through iOS and Android smart device apps, push and email informs, and 30-day event-footage storage for unrestricted cameras, including the SimpliSafe Video Doorbell Pro, which is readily available separately. Without the $25 plan, you handle all controls via the keypad.</p>

<p>This Arlo Pro 2 camera also works as a motion detector. It is equipped with a PIR (Passive Infrared) Motion Sensor, so whenever there's some motion spotted, it can send you a push notification in your phone so you can react to it right away. Furthermore, the motion sensor here is even more innovative than the ones provided by adobe Beginner Kit.

Nest's Secure has the very best style of any system I checked, including smart things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system.
