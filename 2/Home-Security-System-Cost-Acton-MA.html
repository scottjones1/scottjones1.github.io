<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal because the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once customers realize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
