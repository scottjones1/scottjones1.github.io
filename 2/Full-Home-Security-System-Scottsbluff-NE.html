<p>Flood lights are frequently used in conjunction with motion detectors. When sensors discover motion, the lights light up the surrounding location, which will allow you to see who is on your home and will potentially frighten intruders.

Flood lights can deter vandals or terrify them away, however as a single tool, they are more for your peace of mind than for home protection.</p>
