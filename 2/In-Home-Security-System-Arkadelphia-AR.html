Theft avoidance is a necessary precaution to guarantee the safety of your personal belongings. An alarm system can serve a number of functions to this end. In some cases, its presence can function as a deterrent-- intruders are less apt to target an area where it is most likely that they will come across such interference.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.
