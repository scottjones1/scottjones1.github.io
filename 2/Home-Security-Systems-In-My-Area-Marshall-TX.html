<p>The Hive View provides excellent 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation set off too quickly, even when on the most affordable sensitivity setting. Because this camera has no native geofencing functions, you need to by hand stop notifications (and recording, given that it does that even when alerts are off). We also experienced above-average connection problems, with 2 Hive test systems disconnecting 8 times over two months. Scout is really easy to utilize, specifically if you're a fan of mobile phones. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based browsers, and it allows you to manage practically every element of the security system remotely, and it's extremely customizable. Inside the app, you can even control email subscriptions, SMS alerts, or the in-app notices.</p>
<p>The Canary is among the biggest cameras we tested, and it uses two-way communication with its paid Canary Membership. The cost of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent during our testing. The Netatmo Welcome doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to recognize already-identified faces. And regardless of having an attractive price and good efficiency, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has confusing cloud storage that includes $65 to $150 each year to the cost of an otherwise spending plan camera.</p>
