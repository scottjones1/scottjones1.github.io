Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we frequently found action missing out on, thanks to irregular and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
