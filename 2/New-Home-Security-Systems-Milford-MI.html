<p>To figure out the best home security systems, we took a look at the item offerings from 58 companies. We thought about major enduring market gamers, as well as tech-savvy startups.

<p>Closed circuit television (CCTV) surveillance is a type of situational criminal offense prevention designed to avoid both personal and home criminal activity and can be utilized in place of, or in addition to, police. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transfer pictures of a specific area of interest and are either monitored remotely by security workers or preprogramed to scan the specified area (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is thought that the increased surveillance provided by CCTV will decrease crime and increase arrest, without displacing criminal offense to other neighboring locations where CCTV is not in use (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
