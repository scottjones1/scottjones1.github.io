Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we frequently discovered action missing, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
