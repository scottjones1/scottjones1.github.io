<p>Discover how to create, develop, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase worker safety and minimize crime. The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, however it pumps images approximately 4K resolution and has a fantastic daytime image. In our testing, however, we found the motion sensing unit to be sensitive, with dreadful night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are verifying with Arlo whether our unit was faulty, therefore we may revisit this review. Essentially, the Nest camera sits wherever you put it and records what it sees, saving the last five days of footage to the cloud.
