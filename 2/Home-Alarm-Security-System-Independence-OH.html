<p>Home security systems and contemporary clever home capabilities and compatibilities allow you to tap into their sensors and cameras straight from your phone. Search for a model that uses a high resolution (1080p), a broad angle lens (140 to 180 degrees), a night vision range as much as 25 feet, and budget friendly cloud storage for taped video.

It can compare basic motion and people, so it reduces incorrect alarms, and it can even identify individuals you have actually labeled (after a learning period). However like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.
