If alarm use led to improved public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer thefts throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more evident. Nevertheless, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute considerably to authorities ability to capture intruders makes the underwriting of alarm action by cops and whole neighborhoods (all taxpayers fund police reaction to alarmed homes) a costly and ineffective  technique to robbery reduction across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
