<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
