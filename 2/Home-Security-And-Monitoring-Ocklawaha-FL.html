<p>Get best-in-class security, plus smart home automation the entire household will love. ADT is a household name, so we often experiment with their systems to ensure they're still up-to-task. In our latest round of screening, we realized that ADT is the most popular provider for a reason. We think their home protection + home automation + video packages are nipping at the heels of Vivint. That is, they made us feel secure in our home and kept us plenty busy with nifty clever home functions. We particularly liked the ADT Pulse App and controls.</p>
<p>This system launches ADT into the 2020s with clever cameras, optional self-monitoring, a free mobile app, and reasonable prices.
