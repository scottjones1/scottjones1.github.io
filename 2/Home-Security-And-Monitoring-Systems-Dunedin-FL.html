Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to transmit the WiFi info. (You need to play this at full volume or it won't work). Windows smash, canines growl, cats squeal, children sob. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first 10 seconds. It doesn't work. And it never ever works.</p>

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
