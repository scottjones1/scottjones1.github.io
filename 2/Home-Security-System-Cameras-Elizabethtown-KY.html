<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, a lot of alarm systems work the specific same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electric current. When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If somebody were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door permits the electrical current to flow throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the alarm system will set off.</p>
