For starters, it looks stunning: the all-white design and black camera face are seriously spacey (if strangely reminiscent of the AI in 2001: An Area Odyssey). When you think of a home security camera, it's far from the ghastly metal CCTV box that you might call to mind.</p>

<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a form of situational crime avoidance created to prevent both personal and residential or commercial property criminal activity and can be utilized in location of, or in addition to, authorities. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transfer pictures of a particular area of interest and are either monitored remotely by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the specified location (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is believed that the increased surveillance supplied by CCTV will lower crime and boost arrest, without displacing crime to other neighboring locations where CCTV is not in use (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
