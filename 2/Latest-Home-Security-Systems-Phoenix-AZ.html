<p>Discover how to design, build, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase staff member safety and minimize criminal offense. The Ring Floodlight Webcam combines 2 vital devices in one: A home security camera and a motion-activated floodlight. When the Floodlight camera discovers movement, it turns on its two powerful LED beams along with its sharp 1080p camera, and begins recording. The Floodlight Webcam also has a loud speaker, so you can speak with whoever remains in front of the camera, and hear their responses. Outdoor cameras are one of the best ways to discourage (and catch) intruders, vandals, and other rascals. Like indoor security cameras, they can be integrated as part of a home security system or utilized separately to up the security level around your home.</p>

There's no external alarm either. Other packages are offered that have extra sensors and crucial fobs, too.</p>
