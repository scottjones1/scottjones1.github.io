<p>Some home insurance suppliers need you to have an alarm system as part of their policy. However, alarms needed by insurance companies need to comply with the European Standard EN 50131 and should be installed by an NSI or SSAIB certified installer.

However, in our tests the familiar-face alerts worked only about half of the time and the camera consistently detached from the network multiple times a day (when everything else on our network appeared fine).

<p>Best Professional Installation Security Company - While some security systems provide easy DIY installation, other companies provide (and sometimes need) professional installation. Expert installation is offered for hardwired and wireless home security systems. Keep in mind that cameras with two-way audio typically work like walkie talkies. You push a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's occurring on the other end. And while this is a quite standard feature in indoor cameras, two-way audio is relatively unusual in outdoor security cameras.</p>
<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later produced to deal with the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be cracked. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily chosen words) makes pre-shared crucial WPA essentially uncrackable. The 2nd generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based upon the final IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 standard and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance. With all those encryption plans, any customer in the network that knows the keys can check out all the traffic.</p>

If you do not have a landline or are considering dropping yours-- a cellular security system can help you conserve you money on phone bills.
