Hey Rebeca, thanks for this blog site. I am so grateful that you have actually mentioned about clever home integration Simply last week I was offered lot of cameras to install by a homeowner, sadly the owner did not buy cameras suitable with his home automation systems. So we had to acquire new cameras.</p>

However, you will have to pay for additional $2.99 cloud camera storage (per camera) per month, and this doesn't come with expert monitoring. This additional cost isn't ideal, but when compared to the Frontpoint and Vivint $40-and $45- particular minimum prices per month for monitoring, Scout Alarm is a steal.</p>
