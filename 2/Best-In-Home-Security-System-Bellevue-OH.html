We enjoy that the system includes a wifi security camera and only informs you when motion is produced by something with the same heat pattern as a human (guaranteeing there's no incorrect informs). However, you do need to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 each month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get signals on your phone if the sensors have been activated.

A 2nd alarm signal-- received in a surrounding zone within a short time-- is the confirmation the central-station monitor needs to request a dispatch immediately. This builds in increased protection and a fail safe ought to a door blow open or a bird rattle an outside window.</p>
