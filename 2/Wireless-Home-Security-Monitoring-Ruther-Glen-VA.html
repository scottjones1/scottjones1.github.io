Instead, you can filter occasion notifications only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more useful.
