By looking up the license plate numbers of cars parked at the club and investigating the backgrounds of the automobiles' owners, he tried to blackmail clients who were wed. Envision what someone like that could do with a citywide spy-camera system.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely normal given that the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when clients recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
