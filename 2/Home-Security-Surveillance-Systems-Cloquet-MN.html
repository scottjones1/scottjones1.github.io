The one major advantage of 4K resolution is the capability to resolve information after the fact, which indicates that users can focus on details such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. Nevertheless, while 4K resolution uses some advantages, it also brings with it some downsides. 4K images are large and take up a great deal of taping storage area.
