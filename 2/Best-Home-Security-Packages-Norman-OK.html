<p>So, while alarm systems might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a total security package, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the community should take on a share of the cost. If alarm usage resulted in improved public safety-- that is, alarms caused much greater burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer robberies across a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more apparent. Nevertheless, the reality that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute significantly to authorities ability to nab burglars makes the underwriting of alarm response by police and whole communities (all taxpayers fund police action to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a costly and ineffective  method to theft decrease across an entire jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Hybrid systems use both wired and wireless sensors to accomplish the advantages of both. Transmitters can also be linked through the properties' electrical circuits to transfer coded signals to the control unit (line provider).
