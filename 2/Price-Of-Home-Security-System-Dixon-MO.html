Your system can serve as a hub for approximately 119 smart home devices, and can be managed via Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Apple TELEVISION, and more. IP cameras can also be linked to what is known as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends information from the camera and provides power to it.

<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were outstanding in our screening-- throughout the day and at night-- with a broad, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We must note that the camera would periodically downgrade the photo quality based upon offered bandwidth, which might fluctuate throughout the day. Nest consists of the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that may beat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
