<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>

<p>So, while alarm may have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a total security package, the question remains whether non-alarm owners in the community ought to take on a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in boosted public safety-- that is, alarms caused much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less robberies throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more obvious. Nevertheless, the fact that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute substantially to police capability to collar burglars makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by cops and entire communities (all taxpayers subsidize cops action to alarmed properties) a ineffective and pricey technique to robbery decrease throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>
