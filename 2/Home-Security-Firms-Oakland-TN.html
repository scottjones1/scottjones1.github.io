<p>As a temptation to buy an alarm, a number of companies provide "complimentary monitoring services" for the first few months. Many insurer use discount rates on insurance coverage premiums to customers with operable alarm. These discounts might be as much as 20 percent for commercial customers, and slightly less for residential owners. 16 In addition, lots of police departments use several "totally free" false alarms before imposing any fine, even though the cost to respond is considerable right from the start. The offers of free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance companies call into question the appropriateness of the present trend in U.S. policing of allowing three or 4 complimentary false alarms per calendar year, due to the fact that they offer no up-front rewards to motivate owners to avoid false alarms.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
