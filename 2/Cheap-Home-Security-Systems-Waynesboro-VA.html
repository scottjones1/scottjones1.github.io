<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific however good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor.
