<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel posted a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system using a $2 remote. When it found any type of disturbance, SimpliSafe reacted with a statement saying the system would inform users. The company also questioned the video, claiming that there would need to be a perfect storm of situations for someone to successfully hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using two various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors located 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to duplicate the concern.
