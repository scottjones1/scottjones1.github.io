Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using two various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units located 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to replicate the problem. Although our screening should not be taken as definitive, our company believe this issue is unlikely to be a real-world issue for SimpliSafe customers who own the current system.</p>
