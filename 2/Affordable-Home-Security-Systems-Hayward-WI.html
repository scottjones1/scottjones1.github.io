<p>We still believe the Ring Alarm is an excellent alternative for a cheap home security system with wise home support. But possibly skip the cameras in the meantime. Hard disk storage is safe, secure, and hassle-free, with lots of systems using expansion and complimentary cloud storage, such as Arlo Pro 2 Wireless Home Security System. Where does the video feed go? Does the camera store to an SD card, which you'll need to manually get rid of to move the data? Does it go to your mobile phone, or upload to services like Dropbox? For the greatest security, you desire the data to be supported in numerous places. Another aspect is the number of days of video footage are archived.

<p>The Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is among the most expensive home security cameras around, however it's also one of the smartest, too.

It needs to be plugged in to work-- no battery alternative here, sorry-- but the camera includes a 25-foot power cord, which ought to aid with installation.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
