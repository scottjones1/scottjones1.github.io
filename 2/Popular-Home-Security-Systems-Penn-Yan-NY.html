<p>Alarm monitoring is part of a total home security system. It sounds an alarm within the home (frequently extremely high decibel so that you can hear it as can next-door neighbors in some cases) and sounds an alarm with a professional monitoring company. The control panel communicates with the other parts of the system, including the cameras, doors and window sensors, and motion sensing units, to discover an intruder or something that is wrong. Then, the monitoring company immediately sets to action, getting in touch with you and informing the authorities.</p>

And if you want to conserve 4K videos, it's an additional $1.99 per camera monthly, on top of the monthly plan, the latter of which is waived for the very first year.
