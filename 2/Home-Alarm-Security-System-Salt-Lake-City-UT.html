<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Also great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
