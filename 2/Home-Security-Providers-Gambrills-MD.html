<p>The downside to a wireless system is that it depends on a wireless signal, meaning that storms and strong winds have the power to interfere with the system and might even set off incorrect alarms. False alarms are understood to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could result in fines from the provider or the authorities if they take place regularly enough. Another potential disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool need to be changed or charged routinely in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more pricey than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is typically balanced out by the truth that there are no installation costs.</p>
<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel published a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system using a $2 remote. SimpliSafe responded with a statement stating the system would inform users when it spotted any kind of interference. The company also questioned the video, claiming that there would need to be an ideal storm of situations for somebody to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using 2 various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors situated 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to duplicate the issue. Although our testing should not be taken as definitive, our company believe this problem is unlikely to be a real-world problem for SimpliSafe consumers who own the current system.</p>
<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>
