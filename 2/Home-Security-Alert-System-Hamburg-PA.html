Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I evaluated, consisting of creative things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit. But the Secure is expensive, extra sensors are pricey, and the monitoring service-- which does not include emergency alarm or camera backups-- is also expensive if you don't devote to a three-year contract.</p>
