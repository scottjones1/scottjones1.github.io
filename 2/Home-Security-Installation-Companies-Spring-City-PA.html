<p>Three big benefits of wireless security systems for occupants are their expandability, impermanence and mobility. Occupants, unlike property owners, typically prevent making irreversible changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't practical; they include drilling into walls and setting up permanent electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entrances with removable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other components can quickly be set up at different properties later on, and wireless systems are easily broadened with new components too. Wireless security plans also allow push-button control of the system and general home automation.
