As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally normal since the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
