We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Cam (KC120) for among our top spots. Nevertheless, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of up to 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can tape-record up to 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, but entries were typically missing, regardless of appearing in the app's activity timeline. With basic smart home gadgets like automatic door locks, you can stay in bed and check that you locked your doors.
