<p>So, while alarm may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of an overall security package, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood should carry a share of the cost. If alarm use led to enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms led to much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less break-ins across a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more apparent. Nevertheless, the fact that alarm calls are extremely false and do not contribute significantly to authorities ability to capture burglars makes the underwriting of alarm response by police and entire communities (all taxpayers subsidize authorities response to alarmed homes) a expensive and inefficient  method to robbery decrease throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>
