In addition to operating as a deterrent, cameras can inform cops of criminal activities as they occur, which can enable officers to respond quickly and effectively (La Vigne et al. 2011).

The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation slowly evolved into the highly advanced yet budget friendly systems offered today. The first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to record video and enjoy it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to enhance the outcome of security systems.</p>
<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests possible transgressors are less likely to commit crime if they think they are being watched or have a greater threat of being nabbed. This is likewise referred to as the logical choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational crime avoidance method, which argues that chances to anger can be reduced by modifying a range of mechanisms such as increasing the threat of a wrongdoer being apprehended, increasing the effort to dedicate the criminal offense, decreasing rewards from crime commission, and decreasing provocations that trigger criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011). This implies that the wrongdoer must know the added surveillance for it to achieve its desired impact.</p>
