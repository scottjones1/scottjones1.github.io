<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally normal considering that the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone entering the shop.

<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring subtle but profound modifications to the character of our public areas. When people are being seen by the authorities - or mindful they may be watched at any time - they are more self-conscious and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has mentioned, "understanding that you are being watched by armed government agents tends to put a damper on things. You do not want to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he alerts, "people might learn to be careful about the periodicals and books they read in public, avoiding titles that may alarm hidden observers. They may also put more believed into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang hookers, druggies or members." Indeed, the studies of cameras in Britain found that people deemed to be "out of time and location" with the environments were subjected to prolonged surveillance.</p>
