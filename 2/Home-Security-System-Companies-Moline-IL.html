<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally typical because the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as consumers recognize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's usually far too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>

Both are similarly susceptible to false alarms, so it depends upon your individual choice.
