<p>When using IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the big quantity of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and often over long distances.

In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for further wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch.
