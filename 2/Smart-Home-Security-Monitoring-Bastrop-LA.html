From security notifies to optional live surveillance video and far more, FederalConnect uses added convenience and comfort.

The radio frequency allows the alarm's sensors throughout your home to communicate with the control panel. Then the wireless control panel communicates with the monitoring station through a cellular network, also known as cellular monitoring, hence eliminating the need for a landline.</p>
