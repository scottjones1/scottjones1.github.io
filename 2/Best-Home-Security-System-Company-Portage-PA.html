<p>Pelco provides video surveillance cameras and video management services for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping others, hotels, and centers. Some people might state that we ought to not have surveillance cameras in public places. They claim that they invade privacy. The argument here, however, is why be out in public if you want privacy? Surveillance cameras are meant to keep you and other residential or commercial property safe, not to stalk you. Cameras exist not to get into a person's privacy but to protect the public by preventing criminal activity and by supplying material evidence when a criminal activity has been captured on movie.</p>

It's motion-activated and has a speaker system, letting you send out voice cautions through your phone. The lens covers 140 degrees and lets you focus on the action. Like the Ping camera, the Vivint Outdoor Camera records 20-second clips. After we used the Anker EufyCam for almost six months, we're stunned to report that it is on track to provide on its promise of up to one year of battery life.

Bullet cameras tend to be amongst the most popular outdoor alternatives because their style enables minimum glare.

<p>The NVR removes these issues, because it is instead linked directly to a network.

In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will work with a given video recorder before purchasing.</p>
