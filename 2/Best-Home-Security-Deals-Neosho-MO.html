<p>Some home insurance providers need you to have an alarm system as part of their policy. Nevertheless, alarms required by insurer should abide by the European Standard EN 50131 and should be installed by an NSI or SSAIB certified installer. All of the smart alarms on the market presently do not adhere to the European Requirement, and as they're designed to be self-installed, they won't be accepted by your insurer.

For that reason, each house owner has to consider their own danger tolerance, but it's normally worth purchasing a real home security system that uses solid assurance.</p>
