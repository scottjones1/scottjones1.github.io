<p>Closed circuit television (CCTV) surveillance is a form of situational crime avoidance developed to avoid both personal and residential or commercial property criminal offense and can be utilized in place of, or in addition to, cops. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transfer pictures of a specific area of interest and are either monitored remotely by security workers or preprogramed to scan the specified area (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is believed that the increased surveillance offered by CCTV will reduce crime and increase arrest, without displacing criminal activity to other neighboring locations where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
