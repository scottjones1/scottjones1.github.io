<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, because it is rather linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the exact same network, normally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, just because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is linked to the exact same network as the NVR.
