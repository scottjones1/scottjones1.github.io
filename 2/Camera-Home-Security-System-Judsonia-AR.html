<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely suggest.</p>
