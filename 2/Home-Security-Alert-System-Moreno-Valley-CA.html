The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, however it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has an excellent daytime image.

A thermal camera includes a heat sensor that is capable of identifying small distinctions in temperature level. The device gathers the infrared radiation from items in the scene and produces an electronic image based on information about the temperature differences. Since items are rarely precisely the exact same temperature level as other objects around them, a thermal camera can discover them, and they will look like distinct in a thermal image.</p>
