The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that.
