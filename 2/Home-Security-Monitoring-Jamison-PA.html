<p>Think of it this way, if a good still-camera costs a minimum of two hundred and fifty dollars (United States $), how can a more advanced video camera be sold for the low rate of forty dollars? It simply does not build up. To provide such low prices, makers must cut corners, and the end result is compromised performance.

In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR.
