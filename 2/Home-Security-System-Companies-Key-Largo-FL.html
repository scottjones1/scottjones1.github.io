ADT does not have the strongest customer support credibility amongst the companies we considered, acquiring more than 3,000 problems on its Better Business Bureau page While we chalked the majority of this up to the reality that ADT has numerous million more consumers than its competitors, our tester began his call with low expectations.</p>
<p>Some wireless security providers have extra features and plans for an added cost. You'll have to pay a annual or month-to-month fee if you 'd like to have constant video recording and cloud storage for your security cameras.
