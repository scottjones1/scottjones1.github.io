<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were excellent in our screening-- during the day and during the night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We must keep in mind that the camera would sometimes downgrade the photo quality based upon available bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day.

I am very pleased with this product! The cameras were better than anticipated and I like the benefit of having the ability to inspect it from my phone while I'm not home.</p>
<p>The Canary is one of the biggest cameras we evaluated, and it offers two-way interaction with its paid Canary Membership. The price of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, however the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent during our screening. The Netatmo Invite doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces. And regardless of having an attractive cost and good performance, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has confusing cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 per year to the cost of an otherwise spending plan camera.</p>
