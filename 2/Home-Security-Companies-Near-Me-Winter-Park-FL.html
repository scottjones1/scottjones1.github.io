<p>TP-Link's Kasa Cam Outdoor (KC200) has 1080p images and a 130-degree field of vision that might equal a few of our top picks. It also comes with two days of totally free cloud storage (with an alternative for more ), which can pack in clips of approximately 3 minutes. Nevertheless, we had a handful of tests where recordings eliminated in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second gaps in between clips. Protective Systems utilizes a touch-screen control board and keypads, different sensing units (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide gas, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes.
